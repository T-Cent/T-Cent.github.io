We are the math club of IIITD. This repository is a website (which can be accessed at <a href=t-cent.github.io style=color:green>t-cent.github.io</a>)

Inside the `Physics` folder is another website that is (being) made for my DIS final project, which is a physics simulator. If it turns out well, I'll integrate into the main website.

If you're wondering why I didn't host this <a href=https://github.com/evariste-club style=color:green> on our official github</a>, that'd be because of <a href=https://github.com/evariste-club/evariste-club.github.io style=color:green>evariste-club.github.io</a> which is a website which serves a leaderboard for our CTF's! Arguably I could have interchanged them (or just made them one), we'll see.

> You'll have to `git clone --recurse-submodules` if you wish to also get the `web-physics-simulator` folder, as that is a repository, found at [https://github.com/T-Cent/web_physics_simulator](this link).
